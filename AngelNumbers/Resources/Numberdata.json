Your angel number can be determined by paying attention to repetitive numbers that seem to stand out to you, or through meditation and asking your angels for guidance. Some people also like to seek help from an experienced numerologist who can help you determine your angel number."

        "meaning": "Another way to raise your vibration is to empower yourself by changing your thoughts from the negative to the positive. You can do this by writing or saying an affirmation. An affirmation is declaring the truth through a positive statement.

I am willing to see and feel their loving presence.’ In essence, you are raising your vibration to experience the possibilities of the angelic realm. If your thoughts are filled with fear and doubt you will continue to experience the same. As you think, so shall you be. In essence, you need to fake it until you make it through the use and power of affirmations.

       "numberId": "Energy and Vibration",
        "meaning": "It’s important to understand the concept of energy and vibration so you can experience the angels with all your senses. As discussed before, you are energy and the angels are energy. If this is true, then why can’t you see the angels like you can see other human beings? It has to do with the concept of vibration. The meaning of vibration from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is, a characteristic emanation, aura, or spirit that infuses or vitalizes someone or something and that can be instinctively sensed or experienced. Here is the key: In order to see or feel the energy of the angels, you need to raise your vibration to be in tune with their energy. The angels vibrate in the energy of pure divine love and humans resonate between the energy of fear and love. The energy of fear resonates at a lower vibration, while the energy of love resonates at a higher vibration. Think about the last time you were around someone who was angry, depressed, or confused. What VIBE did you get from that person? Did they lift you up or bring you down? Now think of an occasion when you were with someone who was fun, who made you laugh, and you had a really good time. What vibe did you get from this person? Did her energy lift your spirits or bring you down?"
